# O-GIS / web / js

The following JS libraries should be added to this folder:

- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- jQuery-contextMenu by B. Brala, R. Rehm, C. Baartse, A. Osmani
- jQuery-minicolors by Cory LaViska
- OpenLayers 2.* by OpenGeo

Additionally, to keep jQuery-contextMenu CSS unchanged, the following images will have to be updated:

- ./ <jQuery-contextMenu folder> /images/cut.png → cut option is used as "add to favorites"
- ./ <jQuery-contextMenu folder> /images/page_white_delete.png → delete option is used as "remove layer from editor"
- ./ <jQuery-contextMenu folder> /images/page_white_edit.png → edit option is used as "change layer's style"
