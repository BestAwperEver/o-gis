# O-GIS project

O-GIS is an Symfony-CMS-based web-GIS that allows its users to upload raster (GeoTiff, WorldImage Tiff) and vector (ESRI ShapeFile) layers, stylize them, view them and combine them into maps/compositions with custom styling options. O-GIS also can perform basic raster analysis: raster reclassification and raster algebra.
